# C - Binary trees
* Tree data structires are non-linear, hierachy-based, have nodes which are linked and stem from a root.
* A binary tree is a tree datastructure with a maximum of 2 children nodes. It may be called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#cite_note-Knuth1997-3">bifurcating arborescence</a>
* Full Binary Tree: All nodes have 0 or 2 children nodes
* Complete Binary Tree: a tree filled, maybe not fully, but in order 
* Perfect Binary Tree: all leaf nodes have the same depth
* Balanced: absolute height difference of left and right subtrees <= 1

* Tree traversal may be:
  * In-order: L, P, R
  * Pre-order: P, L, R
  * Post-order: L, R, P where:
    ```
         P
       /   \
      L     R
    ```
* Height vs. Depth: Height of <em>tree</em> and Depth of <em>node</em>
